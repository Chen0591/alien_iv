This is a game development project for programming beginners to practice and learn. 
Using Pygame, I will explore managing graphics, animations, and even sounds, making it easier for you to develop complex games. 
By leveraging Pygame to handle tasks such as drawing images on the screen, you can focus more on the higher-level logic of your program, avoiding the many tedious and challenging coding details.
